// Visual system for the Abacus series.
//
// This REPLACES the earlier "port the app's background" approach. The app's ambient
// orb/sparkle layer is UI chrome: pale by design, because app content sits on top of it.
// A video needs the opposite — saturated colour fields, high-contrast cards, and a real
// *place* per scene. The reference is the phonics series (eng/video-pipeline): sky-and-
// hills with a word train for ai_ay, a split night/day field for oo.
//
// What stays from the app: the place-value colour scale (it is on screen in Free Mode),
// the soroban geometry, and the 1-heaven/4-earth layout. Everything else is video-grade.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------- abacus hardware

// The app's beads are hexagons — "poligon" — which is also the true soroban bead
// profile: flat top and bottom, tapered to a point at each side. The first build drew
// ellipses, which read as pale pills and was the main reason the frame looked flat.
export const BEAD_HEX = { shoulder: 0.22 }; // side taper as a fraction of bead width

// Warm wood frame + cream panel, so the abacus reads the same on a bright world and on
// a dark one. Per-theme app colours were dropped: poligon_cyan gave a pale bead on a
// pale panel, and the active/inactive difference was nearly invisible.
